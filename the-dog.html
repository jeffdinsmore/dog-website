  <h1>Rufus the Dog</h1>
  <h2>A typical day in the life of Rufus</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Rufus has his morning breakfast of T-bone steaks with a side of dog treats</li>
    <li>He then carries his 200lb self outside to enjoy the sun</li>
    <li>By midday Rufus no longer has the energy to move, so his human carries/drags him inside</li>
    <li>Rufus then sleeps for 7 days straight, entering a possible food coma due to the possible overdose of T-bone steaks and dog treats</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Rufus' Toy Selection Includes:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>His Ball</li>
    <li>Any shoes he finds</li>
    <li>His Dino Bone</li>
    <li>The neighbors cat</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Thanks from Rufus!</p>
